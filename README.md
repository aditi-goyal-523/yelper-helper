# The Yelper Helper: Providing recommendations to Yelp users based on their prior review history

### Team Members: Aditi Goyal , Akayla Hackson , Neeraj Mathur

### Project Description:

#### Motivation: 
Yelp is a widely used platform designed to recommend businesses and services, ranging from restaurants to nail salons. Despite its popularity, the platform can be cumbersome to use. Searching for new restaurants and services can be tedious and time consuming for yelp users. They must search numerous options and read multiple reviews per option to determine if it is a good fit.
Here we use machine learning techniques to perform 3 experiments:

1. predict the star rating of a restaurant based on a set of reviews
2. recommend a restaurant to a user based on their star ratings
3. explore the potential of OpenAI in performing these tasks.


Our full results are detailed in the final report, uploaded as a pdf on this repository. You can also get an overview of this project through our research poster, presented at the Stanford Department of Computer Science Machine Learning Research Convention. 

#### Dataset: 
We will use the following Yelp dataset available as JSON files. This dataset is a subset of businesses, reviews, and user data as follows
6,990,280 reviews
150,346 businesses
200,100 pictures
11 metropolitan areas
908,915 tips by 1,987,897 users
Over 1.2 million business attributes like hours, parking, availability, and ambiance
Aggregated check-ins over time for each of the 131,930 businesses
